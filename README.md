Just looking at the presentations and jotting down a few ideas

 - [ ] Friendline: A tool that analyses feeds of friends to determine who you
 should get in touch with. Maybe a friend in distress that could use a call
 from a friend
  - IBM's stack of tools
 - [ ] InterDNS: A proxy DNS server that performs secure lookups. Inside the
 intranet one can use regular DNS, but they will have some guarantee that once
 the proxy DNS is configured for lookups, all traffic into the web will be
 secure. Better than just regular DNS, I guess.
 - [ ] Watson CLI
   - installable
   - slack extension
   - text service :smile:
 - [ ] Open Phone system: Allow routing of calls from crowd-sourced networks to
 traditional networks (internationally).
   - is there sufficient bandwith for audio?
   - get phonenumbers in the US and EU
   - allow people to call anyone in the supported regions and route those calls
   through the available number.
   - user all pay by donating
   - calls within the network are just VOIP (no routing over traditional
   trunks)
 - [ ] todoist cli
 - [ ] todoist github task mash
 - [ ] todoist-compass: allows one to specify lists by location (grocery store)
 and suggest a user an item to perform based on the location. That way if I
 have specified to to a few things at the office, todoist would bulk them up
 nicely and then propose a set of activities that get me out of the office by
 following a sensible route to get the things done (e.g.: groceries first,
 send a postcard to mom, then pickup some takeaway, after which a few office
 activities follow, before I do that workout I had planned)
   - could use Watson's AI for this maybe?!? (long shot)
